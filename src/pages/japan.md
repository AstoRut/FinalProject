excerpt: It's been a while since I was in Japan, but I still remember the excitement of being there, despite not having the best camera equipment with me at the time with which to document my journey.  From the densely populated capital city of Tokyo, to the more laid back and historical city of Nara (known for their temples and endless deer), Japan made a lasting impression on me.
