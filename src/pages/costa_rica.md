excerpt: Costa Rica is a beautiful country with lots of nature to explore and very friendly and welcoming people. With activities ranging from zip-lining to relaxing on the beach, you could easily spend a couple weeks here and never run out of things to do and see. This is one destination where I would definitely recommend renting a car, as you'll want to travel around the country to see everything it has to offer.
