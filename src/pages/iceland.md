excerpt: If I had to pick the single most beautiful place I've ever visited, I would have to say it's Iceland. I feel as though I've seen some jaw-dropping sights around the world, but Iceland takes the cake. You'll notice I've selected two waterfall pictures, and while the waterfalls in Iceland were stunning, there was so much more to see.  Drive the Golden Circle, and you'll find yourself stopping very frequently to take in your surroundings. It's truly a world-class buffet for the eyes.
