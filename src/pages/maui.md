excerpt: Maui, Hawaii is one of the most laid back and scenic places there is.  The Garden of Eden Arboretum has views so stunning that it was featured in the original Jurassic Park movie.  There are too many breath-taking beaches to be counted, including black sand beaches, many of which are frequented by sea turtles and all sorts of tropical fish.  If you enjoy nature and hiking as well, Maui should definitely be towards the top of your list.
