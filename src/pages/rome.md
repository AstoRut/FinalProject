excerpt: Italy holds a special place in my heart, as most of my ancestors were from here. I've been to a handful of cities in Italy, but Rome is unlike any other and has so much history that it's hard to even compare. There are so many sights you'll see that you've seen on TV or in pictures, and they're just as mesmerizing in real life.  I'm sure I'm biased, but the food in Rome was some of the best I've ever had.
