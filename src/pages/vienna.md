excerpt: Truthfully, I could have selected a handful of other destinations in Europe. I love London, Paris, etc, but Vienna doesn't seem to get the recognition it deserves. Because of its proximity to Budapest (another great city), I'd recommend doing both at once. But focusing on Vienna, I'd say it is one of the most pristine and gorgeous cities I've visited. It truly feels like what you would imagine the home of Beethoven would be. The city is rich with history that feels so well-maintained, yet brand new at the same time. Vienna should be on the radar of every traveler who wants to explore Europe.
