excerpt: New York is my favorite city in the world, hands down. But Chicago
  shares a lot of similarities with New York, though it's smaller (and
  cleaner). While there's definitely less going on in Chicago, it has
  its own allure. With a vast array of tourist attractions and diverse
  neighbors with their own unique charm, Chicago is a place I'd highly
  recommend for people looking to explore a new city. Maybe just steer
  clear of the winter, for obvious reasons!
