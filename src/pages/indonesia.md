excerpt: Indonesia, the world's 4th most populated country, is a destination that anyone with a sense of adventure should consider.  Though it is basically on the other side of the world (for us Americans), it's well worth the trip.  With several alluring destinations, like Jakarta and Bali, there is a good mix of city strolling and beach relaxing to be had.
