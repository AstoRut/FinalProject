            Taiwan was probably my favorite place in Asia. From the amazing and cheap food (there are night markets everywhere!), to the awesome Taroko National Park, and beautiful monuments and architecture, I was really blown away by this destination. It was difficult to select just two pictures from this trip, as everything I ate and saw was photo-worthy. Getting arouund the island was relatively easy, and it's definitely worth checking out a few different areas. Of course, it helped that I was traveling with someone who was fluent in Chinese.  Still, I highly recommend a journey to Taiwan!
