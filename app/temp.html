            New York is my favorite city in the world, hands down. But Chicago
            shares a lot of similarities with New York, though it's smaller (and
            cleaner). While there's definitely less going on in Chicago, it has
            its own allure. With a vast array of tourist attractions and diverse
            neighbors with their own unique charm, Chicago is a place I'd highly
            recommend for people looking to explore a new city. Maybe just steer
            clear of the winter, for obvious reasons!
