          This page includes information about some of my favorite places that
          I've visited among three continents. I've been to a bunch more places,
          but I'm selecting just three from each continent for now. I hope to
          visit more places as time passes, and eventually perhaps I will add
          more of them to this site.
          <br /><br />
          For now, if you're looking for recommendations, each of these
          destinations has many things to offer. You can get started by taking a
          look at the links in the navigation menu at the top. Each destination
          includes two of my favorite pictures that I took while visiting, as
          well as some brief highlights and must-visit attractions.
