          This page includes information about some of my favorite places that
          I've visited among three continents. I hope to visit more places as
          time passes, but if you're looking for recommendations, each of these
          destinations have many things to offer. Get started by taking a look
          at links in the navigation menu at the top. Here's some more text just
          to test how it looks when it wraps around with the picture and
          whatnot. Maybe it doesn't work as I was hoping, but we're going to see
          if I just keep typing more.
